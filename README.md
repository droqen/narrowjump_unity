 # narrowjump_unity
 
Started from the idea of using Godot to make a platformer with narrow corridors (Pac-Man style I guess) - i usually make pretty wide/broad spaces, but corridors are really interesting!

Anyway, this project is 100% unity now, and I'm exercising my past attempts at making toolkits for myself (navdi, navdi2). I'm relying on the Tiled editor and enjoying it so far, lots of fun little organizational classes that I'm super happy to have at my disposal basically so I don't have to deal with as much Unity Scene Editor as I'm used to having to deal with in Unity.
